NOTE FOR DEBIAN (and possibily other) USERS
-------------------------------------------

There is a problem by using this module, and almost any other 3rd party modules for Webmin, in a Debian installation. 
The Webmin 'deb' package included in a Debian distribution installs the standard Webmin modules in /usr/share/webmin, and the 3rd party modules in /usr/local/share/webmin. 
This doesn't work correctly (although that is the standard layout in Debian filesystem), for almost ANY 3rd party module needs to call the web-lib.pl which reside in the Webmin directory, supposing this to be its parent directory.
For example, a 3rd party module named 'wine' will be installed in /usr/local/share/webmin/wine; from that directory it calls '../web-lib.pl', but in the parent directory /usr/local/share/webmin such a file doesn't exist! It's instead in /usr/share/webmin!
Moreover, many 3rd modules needs also the 'ui-lib.pl' library, and that's the same problem.
Finally, that implementation of Webmin doesn't store correctly the initial config files, so in many cases you have to fill in the module configuration by yourself.

SOLUTIONS:

a) DO NOT USE the Webmin 'deb' packages included in Debian distributions!
Download instead the original tar.gz file directly from www.webmin.com, unpack it, enter its directory, and type:

./setup.sh /usr/share/webmin

So you'll have Webmin installed in your lovely /usr/share/webmin directory, but fully functional, with the 3rd party modules in the same directory and the initial config file correctly stored.

b) If you still want to mantain the Debian standard layout, then:
- Install that module from Webmin;
- After installation, enter the module directory and execute the script 'create_links.pl'. 
This should create two symlinks 'ui-lib.pl' and 'web-lib.pl' in the parent directory, to solve the library dependencies. 
Still, probably you'll have to fill in the module configuration by yourself.
