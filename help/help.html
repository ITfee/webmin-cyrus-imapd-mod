<HEADER>Manage the Mailboxes</HEADER>
<P>To set a quota on a mailbox, just type the quota amount. To remove a
quota, enter a zero value.</P>

To set the ACL (Access Control Lists) on a mailbox/folder:
<UL>
<LI>Choose a REAL user; or type <B>anyone</B> for all users;</LI>
<LI>Set the ACLs:</LI>
    <UL>
<LI><B>l</B> : lookup : The user may see that the mailbox exists</LI>
<LI><B>r</B> : read : The user may read the mailbox. The user may select the
        mailbox, fetch data, perform searches, and copy messages from
        the mailbox.</LI>
<LI><B>s</B> : seen : Keep per-user seen state. The "Seen" and "Recent" flags
        are preserved for the user.</LI>
<LI><B>w</B> : write : The user may modify flags and keywords other than
        "Seen" and "Deleted" (which are controlled by other sets of
        rights).</LI>
<LI><B>i</B> : insert : The user may insert new messages into the mailbox.</LI>
<LI><B>p</B> : post : The user may send mail into a subfolder in the mailbox. E.g. if anyone sends a mail to &quot;user+folder@domain.com&quot;, this mail becomes in the subfolder &quot;folder&quot; (attention, large and lower case are considered!) in the INBOX of &quot;user&quot;. This right differs from &quot;i&quot; by the fact that in the header of message also &quot;user+folder@domain.com&quot; stands.</LI>
<LI><B>c</B> : create : The user may create new sub-mailboxes of the mailbox,
        or delete or rename the current mailbox.</LI>
<LI><B>d</B> : delete : The user may store the "Deleted" flag, and perform
        expunges.</LI>
<LI><B>a</B> : administer : The user may change the ACL on the mailbox.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>click on remove to delete the ACLs for an user</LI>
</UL>
